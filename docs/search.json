    "text": "The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation\nIn this section, the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analyses are used to detect patterns and check the randomness of time series. Figure 3: ACF plots show the autocorrelation remains in cashrate and unemprate even after 5 years. The acf of inflation also indicates the significant autocorrelation in first quarter lag, whereas all other variables do not exhibit significant lags. However, in drealgdp, a spike exceeds the 95% confidence interval in fifth quarter lag; nevertheless, this might occur due to a type I error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: ACF plots\n\n\nFor the pacf in Figure 4: PACF plots, it is observed that there are significant spike for some lags for all variables except dstockprice."
